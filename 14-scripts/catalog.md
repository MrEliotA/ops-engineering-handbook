# Catalog

This note captures production-oriented operating guidance for **Catalog**. Start from evidence, make hypotheses explicit, bound risky changes, and verify from the user/service perspective after intervention.

## Review prompts
- What signal proves this failure mode?
- Which adjacent failure mode can look similar?
- What is the lowest-risk discriminating check?
- What rollback and post-change validation are required?
